The site serves a very specific purpose: to make accessible certain aspects of Indian history, culture and thought. The focus of the site is going to be on Dvaita or Tattvavada. It seeks to synthesize different strains of academic thought with traditional accounts. Though an enterprise of this nature promises neutrality, and that shall be enforced to the best of the author's ability in the analyses that follow, inclusion of subjective elements and biases are inevitable. Unlike the information on sites such as Wikipedia, there is a significant amount of original research included. The reader of the articles might evidence a fondness for the classical Indian civilization and a melancholic romanticism for the past glories (fabricated or otherwise) in certain opinion pieces. Also there may be hints of subdued reverence for certain religious elements that may raise the suspicion that this is a verbose and veiled attempt at propaganda. Though the author is an insider to the community, there is no other agenda than to restore, rehabilitate and preserve aspects of Indian culture.
 
## Description of the site
Information on this site is arranged in articles. These articles are based on the structure adopted by academic research papers, with relevant subheadings, an overarching narrative and references. Concepts which need expansion will be included under appendices. Though fashioned as academic research articles, the treatment is eclectic. The articles can vary in length and depth. Digressions and rabbit holes would be inevitable, but not at the cost of coherence. To limit these flights of fancy, the articles are going to be as specific as possible barring the introductory articles. Footnotes and references will be included at the end of each article. This site is going to be in a state of flux. The articles will improved upon or corrected as I become privy to more information. 

## Scope
The site primarily focussed on Tattvavada. The articles will cover the history, philosophy, theology and cultural aspects of Tattvavada. Because the philosophy does not exist in a vacuum, to set the context, other strains of thought are also covered. As the philosophers and the scholars of Tattvavada hobnobbed with and debated other philosophical schools, one cannot be discussed without the other. Articles on philosophies and concepts other than Tattvavada will be included in the appendices. A glossary of Sanskrit terms is going to be  included as well for reference. I am going to steer clear of political ideologies  though sociological issues such as caste will be dealt with at some point. 

## Objectives
- There is a divide between the discussion of Tattvavada in the academic circles and practice. Dvaita is a living tradition. A disconnected and dry examination of philosophy is incomplete without noting how these ideas are put into practice. 
- The works on Tattvavada (in English) are disconnected and scattered. Though there does exist some literature on Tattvavada, barring the works by B.N.K Sharma, they are too general and broad. They seldom address the detailed tradition beyond Madhva and Jayatirtha. 
- Not much attention has been given to esoteric and theological concepts in Tattvavada.
- The discussions and polemic works are steeped in obscure terminologies and concepts which might alienate people.  An accessible introduction to these terms is necessary. 
- Gaps in the history of Tattvavada still need to be addressed. 
- The cultural ramifications of Tattvavada has largely been ignored. The aesthetics and rituals.
-  Bhakti tradition has mostly been ignored to the diffuse nature of the movement. 
- Much thought needs to put into how Dvaita connects other Indian philosophical schools and Hinduism in general. 
- Dvaita has not been examined through different lenses: sociology, psychoanalytic, literature etc etc.

## Approach
The articles featured on the site will be written from a neutral point of view by which I mean a non-hagiographic tone. Though I might err on the side of verbosity, I shall strive to keep the narrative readable and engaging. I shall be approaching the philosophy of Tattvavada and "Hinduism" in general from a variety of perspectives which will include anthropology, sociology, psychoanalysis and political. A study of a religious thought not only requires an objective analysis which encapsulates the above mentioned perspectives but subjectivity as well. The perspectives are listed below:
- Anthropology
- Comparative Method
- Economics of Religion
- Literary analysis
- Phenomenology
- Philosophy
- Psychology and psychoanalytic perspectives
- Sociology
- Theology
- Ethics

## Process of research
The articles will be a product of research culled from a variety of sources (historical and traditional), interviews and observation. Though I will not be providing inline citations, I will be including a list of sources and footnotes in the articles.  

## Conflict of Interests
I have no political affiliations. The primary reason for this site to exist is to fill a gap in research and draw attention to Tattvavada.
