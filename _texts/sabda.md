## Introduction
I am going to try a strange approach towards introducing Dvaita. I wish I could start from the start and work all the way to current times, but such an undertaking requires experience and insight, both of which I lack. I am learning through the process of writing this article, so excuse my amateurish remarks and dorm-room speculations. Writing any piece requires a sense of the theatrical, a narrative. The narrative need not be overt and neither should it eclipse the soberness of the essay. It needs to connect the points and drive the essay forward. 
Writing about Indian philosophy is challenging. It is an interconnected nexus of statements and replies and arguments and modifications. For anyone outside the scholarly circles of the time, it would be incomprehensible. Starting from the start would have me starting at the Rg Veda (and I will get there. Someday.) and the road is too arduous and long to be productive. Fleshing the framework out bit by bit would work better. A nice way of learning is through hyperlinking from one topic to another. And Vijayindra is a better locus than any to illuminate the principles of Dvaita. His life also throws light on the structure of orthodoxy, the society and culture of the time, the political intrigue and the short memory of the collective in commemorating some and forgetting others.   

## Structure of the Essay
The structure of the essay is bound to change over the time. The essay will start and end with Vijayindra. There is quite a lot of ground to cover before and after him. Hence there may be a lot of shuttling back and forth between his life and the ideas that encapsulate it. Right now I do not have much clarity on it but maybe the framework will become more evident as I progress. 

## A note on succession
Who is Vijayindra? Why did I choose him? It seems like an arbitrary choice. Hardly any credible, historical source exists on his early life and background. This legacy is just paid lip service to. No one talks about him much. It wouldn’t be much of a stretch to say that he is forgotten by the mass. Only a faint trace of his name lives on, as the successor of a notable personality and a predecessor of another notable personality. The fading away of Vijayindra from the collective memory will be dealt later. Let us first put him in context. 
Vijayindra is a “Tirtha”. Although the word can be approximated to mean saint or scholar or Guru, it does not do justice. As is the case with any Sanskrit word, Tirtha has multiple meanings and usages. Tirtha has been used to refer to a pilgrimage, a water body near a temple, the holy water that is dispensed by the priest in a temple and a saint. The word actually means “transition” or “crossing”. A person who transports people over a stream or a lake is a Tirtha (“teer” is the word for bank or the shore and “ratha” is a vehicle).  Any person, place or entity that aids in the transition of a man from the profane world to the sacred is a “Tirtha”. Transmission of knowledge in the Indian religions has been through master and disciple.
