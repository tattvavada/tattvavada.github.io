<div class="introduction">

    <p>Tattvavada is a school of Vedantic thought that promulgates theism, realism and plurality. It was founded by Madhvāchāryā as a direct reaction against the tenets of Advaitā. The site is a repository of articles on the philosophy of Madhvā and his followers but not restricted to it. The articles will focus on the broader implications of the philosophy on the people through history and culture. However, a comprehensive exploration of Tattvavada would be incomplete without a general discussion of Hinduism and the history of the Indian civilization. The articles on Tattvavada are linked below. In the <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/appendices/"> appendices</a>,  I will expand upon the tools I will be using to interpret the philosophy and its impact. Please read the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/prolegomena/">preface</a>  before proceeding. I would suggest reading through the introductory articles to familiarize oneself with the language, concepts, ideas and arguments of Indian philosophy. For setting a deeper context, I would suggest reading through the articles on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hinduism/">hinduism</a> and the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/history/">history of India</a>, as many personalities of Tattvavada lived and operated within these frameworks. As the articles require deep research, I will not work on a time-honoured basis. They will be uploaded when they organically reach a stage of completion. </p>
